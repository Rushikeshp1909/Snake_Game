As Developing the Snake Game in Java allowed me to snatch the importance and practical knowledge of Java concepts such as classes, objects, methods, loops, and conditional statements & game development concepts. and I structured the game using classes to represent different game elements like the snake, food, and game board, score & I've made the code easier to understand and maintain.

Also Implementing the game logic, particularly handling the snake's movement and collision detection, has been a significant learning point. I've learned how to efficiently control the snake's movements and detect when it hits walls or itself.

As creating a simple user interface (UI) for the game challenged me creativity and tested my problem-solving skills. so I used Java Swing components & Jframes to create layouts and colors.
